# Devpass Middle Engineer Test #1

## What is expected?

We love GitHub! üêô ‚ù§Ô∏è 

In this test, you have to implement an integration with [GitHub REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) in order to list public repositories from an user.

## Steps

- Clone this repository.
- Open DevpassMiddleTest1 project using Xcode 12.4.
- Implement the User Stories below.

## User Stories

### US01 - Repositories List

As an user<br>
I want to see a list of repositories of a GitHub user<br>
So I can pick the one I want

#### Acceptance criteria

- This screen must have a text field so the user can type a GitHub user name and press Done to show repositories.
- While the repositories are fetched, show the user a loading state.
- If the user doesn't exist, show an error state.
- Each element of the list should have the repository's name, its main language and the number of stargazers.
- The list should show only 20 public repositories
- The list should be ordered by the last updated repository.

#### UI mockups

## Solution requirements

- Use Xcode 12.4, iOS 14.4 and Swift 5.4.
- Don't use third-party libraries.
- TODO comments give you some hints of tasks you must complete.
- The app is expected to work only for iPhone in portrait mode.
- Keep performance and corner cases in mind. Beware of the retain cycles!
- Follow the UI mockups.
- Don't share your GitHub's personal access token with us. Just tell us where this should be placed in your code. 

## Delivery

- Upload your solution to a new repository in your GitHub account and send the URL to comutechbr@gmail.com;

## Evaluation Method

- Good coding practices and patterns.
- Code readability and reusability.
- View componentization.
- File and folder structure.
- Commit history (no single commit, please).
- We really love tests! üòâ
